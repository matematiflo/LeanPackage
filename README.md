# Basic Lean package (template repository)

This sets up a basic Lean package without a Mathlib dependency. If you want to add Mathlib as a dependency afterwards, see [Adding a Mathlib dependency](#adding-a-mathlib-dependency) or go to the repo

> [https://github.com/matematiflo/MathlibDependency](https://github.com/matematiflo/MathlibDependency)

## Quickstart

If you *already have* [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) installed on your machine, just clone the current repository, either using [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop) or via the command line

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matematiflo/LeanPackage.git
```

Then run the command

```bash
lean HelloWorld.lean
```

It should return `Hello, world!`. At this point, you can also build the whole project by running the command

```bash
lake build
```

For more information on how to run a Lean programme, see the [next section](#running-a-program).

If you do not yet have Lean 4, you can test out the present repo in a [Codespace](#codespaces) (follow the link or read below for instructions).

## Running a program

To try out the main function of the present package,  first build it via the command line

```bash
lake build Main
```

then run the main function via the command line

```bash
lake env lean --run Main.lean
```

Alternately, you can compile `Main.lean` into an executable via the command

```bash
lake build
```

and then run the command line

```bash
.lake/build/bin/UserGreeting
```

It should return `Hello, User!`.

You can then go directly to the [Test file](#test-file) instructions.

## How to build this repo from scratch

1. Create a GitHub repo with an Apache 2.0 license.
2. Clone the repo on a machine which has Lean 4 already installed on it. Alternately, just create an empty directory `LeanPackage` on your machine.
3. From a terminal, run the command `lake init greeting` (inside the cloned repo).
4. Still from a terminal, run the command `lake build`.

The last two steps are taken from the [Lean Manual](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/setup.html#lake). They are enough for the command `./build/bin/greeting` to work and return `Hello, world!`. You do not need to have created a GitHub repo for this to work.

The `lake init greeting` command adds Lean to the repo and creates a Lean package called `greeting`. You can see for instance that the files `lean-toolchain` and `lakefile.lean` have been created. And you can check that this has worked by running the commands

```bash
cat lean-toolchain
```

```bash
cat lakefile.lean
```

The content of `lean-toolchain` should coincide with one of the Lean versions that you have on your machine (check this using `elan show`). Otherwise, you shoudl run the command

```bash
lake update
```

As for the file `lakefile.lean`, its contents should be as follows.

```lean
import Lake
open Lake DSL

package «greeting» where
  -- add package configuration options here

lean_lib «Greeting» where
  -- add library configuration options here

@[default_target]
lean_exe «greeting» where
  root := `Main
  -- Enables the use of the Lean interpreter by the executable (e.g.,
  -- `runFrontend`) at the expense of increased binary size on Linux.
  -- Remove this line if you do not need such functionality.
  supportInterpreter := true
```

The command `lake build` then compiles the package into a binary called `greeting`, which is later run by the command `./build/bin/greeting`.

If you do all of this, you will get a repo with a structure similar to this one, except that the files `HelloWorld.lean`, `Test.lean` and `MathlibTest.lean` will be absent from it, as they are not created by `lake init greeting`. Moreover, in the present repo, the files `lakefile.lean`, `Greeting/Basic.lean` and `Main.lean` have been slightly edited:

- In `lakefile.lean`, the `lean_exe greeting` has been replaced by `lean_exe UserGreeting`.
- In `Greeting/Basic.lean`, the declaration `def hello := "world"` has been replaced by `def MyHello := "User"`.
- In `Main.lean`, the definition `IO.println s!"Hello, {hello}!"` has been replaced by `IO.println s!"Hello, {MyHello}!"`.

The quote signs around the imports have also been removed.

If you want to know more about Lake, you can check out [this blob][LakeREADME].

## Test file

This repo contains an additional test file. You can see it at [Test.lean](Test.lean) and it contains the lines:

```lean
def main : IO Unit :=
  IO.println "Hello, world!"

#eval main

#eval 1 + 1

#check 3

def f (n : Nat) : Nat := 2 * n

#eval f 3

-- #print f
```

You can run `Test.lean` by running the command

```bash
lean Test.lean
```

and it should return

```bash
Hello, world!
2
3 : Nat
6
```

As you can see, there are two functions defined in the file `Test.lean`, one called `main` and the other one called `f`. When you run the file, the program returns everything that is located behind an `#eval` or `#check` command.

For instance, `#eval f 3` computes the value of `f` at the natural number `3`. Since `f` is the function from `Nat` to `Nat` sending `n` to `2 * n`, the return value for `n = 3` is `6`. You can also add `#check f` and see what happens.

If you edit the file to uncomment the line `#print f` by removing the `--` at the beginning of that line, you will see the following in your terminal:

```bash
def f : Nat → Nat :=
fun n => 2 * n
```

This means that `f` is a function that takes a natural number `n`  to the natural number `2 * n`.

Finally, if instead of `lean Test.lean`, you run

```bash
lean Test.lean --run
```

then the program returns `#eval main` one more time (at the very end). This enables you to not include an `#eval main` command if you want to run your function `main` only once and at the end, using the `--run` option.

## Install Lean 4

You can install [Lean 4](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4) by following the instructions in one of the following sources:

- [https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/setup.html](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/setup.html)
- [https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/quickstart.html](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/quickstart.html)
- [https://lean-lang.org/download/](https://lean-lang.org/download/)
- [https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html)

You will need the Lean package manager called [elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan), to install Lean. How you install elan depends on your operating system.

## Install Lean 4 on Mac OS

For a controlled installation of elan and Lean on Mac OS, see

> [https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/macos_details.html](https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/macos_details.html)

It will require you to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) by running the command line:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

If the command `brew` is not recognized by your shell after the installation, see the [Troubleshooting](#homebrew-troubleshooting) section.

Otherwise, follow the steps below:

### Install elan

Install elan (the Lean package manager) by running

```bash
brew install elan-init
```

### Install the latest stable version of Lean

Install the latest stable version of Lean by running

```bash
elan install stable
```

You may need to log off and log in again to your terminal again to make sure that the commands `lean` and `lake` become available. Check that this is indeed the case by running the command line

```bash
lean --version
```

If the stable version is 4.2.0, then the command above should return
`Lean (version 4.2.0, commit 0d7051497ea0, Release)`.

If you want to make the installed version your default version, you can run

```bash
elan default stable
```

As a matter of fact, if the stable version is not yet installed, the command above will also install it. You can check which versions (called *toolchains*) you have installed by running

```bash
elan toolchain list
```

and which one one is the active toolchain by running

```bash
elan show
```

In case of trouble, run `elan help`.

### Homebrew Troubleshooting

If you use `zsh` as a shell in your terminal app, after installing Homebrew, you will need to update your `PATH`. You can do so by following the steps below:

First, run the command line

```bash
echo 'eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)' >> /Users/$USER/.zprofile
```

Then, run the command line

```bash
eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)
```

You should be able to check that this has worked by running the command line `brew help` in a terminal: this should now be recognized by your shell.

## Install Lean 4 from within Visual Studio Code

There is a [Lean 4 extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=leanprover.lean4) in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). It can install [various things](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/quickstart.html) for you directly. And in general, VS Code is a powerful IDE to work on Lean code.

## Adding a Mathlib dependency

If you want to add Mathlib to the present package, follow the instructions below.

### Mathlib test file

This repo contains a file [MathlibTest.lean](MathlibTest.lean), whose contents are as follows.

```lean
import Mathlib.Data.List.Defs

#eval List.sum [1, 2, 3]
```

The function `List.sum` computes the sum of the members of a list. It is defined in `Mathlib.Data.List.Defs`, which is part of Mathlib.

If you run `lake env lean MathlibTest.lean` before installing Mathlib, you will see a list of error messages, starting with one that says `unknown package 'Mathlib'`).

To add a mathlib dependency, do the following.

### Modify `lakefile.lean`

Open the `lakefile.lean` file of the present repo and add to it the following lines

```lean
require mathlib from git 
  "https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4.git"
```

in between the `package` and `lean_lib` lines, to make it look like this:

```lean
package greeting where
  -- add package configuration options here

require mathlib from git 
  "https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4.git"

lean_lib Greeting where
  -- add library configuration options here
```

### Update the Lean version

Run the following command to replace your `lean-toolchain` file with the one used by the version of Mathlib that you are about to install:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/master/lean-toolchain -o lean-toolchain
```

Unless you are already using the same Lean version as Mathlib, this updates the `lean-toolchain` file. You can see it by running `cat lean-toolchain`.

### Install Mathlib

Run the command line

```bash
lake update
```

This will update the Lean version and install a Mathlib dependency in your repo, creating a bunch of new files, including a directory called `lake-packages`.

### Download the compiled Mathlib files

Run the command line

```bash
lake exe cache get
```

This downloads the compiled Mathlib files, so you can avoid compiling them locally (which can take a long time). As a matter of fact, if you use `lake exe cache get` (which is recommended), then you do not need to use `lake update` before that: `lake exe cache get` will both install Mathlib and download the compiled library files.

You can consult the [Leanprover-community](https://leanprover-community.github.io) Wiki for more info:

> [Using mathlib4 as a dependency](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/wiki/Using-mathlib4-as-a-dependency)

### Run the Mathlib test file

After downloading the compiled Mathlib libraries using `lake exe cache get`, run the `MathlibTest.lean` file, via the command line

```bash
lake env lean MathlibTest.lean
```

This computes `List.sum [1, 2, 3]` and you should get the answer `6`, because `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.

## Codespaces

If you wish to work on this project online and without installing anything, you can do so by opening a Codespace. Just follow the link below and click on `Create new codespace` (**GitHub account required**).

[![Open in Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new/matematiflo/LeanPackage)

Alternately, you can open a Codespace by clicking on the [Code button](https://github.com/matematiflo/LeanPackage) of the current repository.

If you commit any modified file from within your Codespace, the repo will be forked to your GitHub account and your work will be saved there.

To leave a Codespace, it is recommended that you stop it before closing the browser window:

1. Click on your Codespace name at the bottom-left of the VS Code interface.
2. Choose `Stop current Codespace` from the list of options.
3. Wait until the Codespace has stopped to close your browser tab.

To access a Codespace that you have previously created, just go to

> [https://github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)

or launch them directly from the Code button of the relevant repository (no setup required this time!).

Note that the Codespace which has been configured for  this repo does *not* include a Mathlib dependency. So you can test out there how to add such a dependency.

If you want a template repository with a Codespace for a Lean package that *does* include a Mathlib dependency, you can go to this repo:
